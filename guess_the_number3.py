    Handles GET and POST requests for the main page of the game. Renders the HTML template
    for the page, which includes an input form for the user to make guesses and buttons
    to submit their guesses or start a new game.

    For POST requests, checks the user's guess against the secret number and updates the range
    of possible numbers based on whether the guess was too high or too low. If the user guessed
    correctly, returns a message indicating they won.
